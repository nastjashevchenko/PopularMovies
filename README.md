Project 1 for Udacity Android Nanodegree

Application needs MovieDB API application key to run correctly,
now it can be added to InternetUtil.java (see comments inside file)

#### Known issues:
- Position in movies list is always at the beginning (is not saved and restored) when user gets back from another screen;
- Sometimes posterts can flash when user is scrolling, looks like Picasso issue;
- Plot text on detailed page overlaps rating and release date section while poster is not loaded.
